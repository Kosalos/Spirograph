Spirograph

3D spirograph uses Metal to calculate the data points.

All the widget boxes work the same way:
Press and hold to either side of center to affect the parameter in the specified direction and speed.
Tap on a widget to zero it's parameters.

R,S control the size and speed of a point rotating round a clock face.
X,Y control the rate at which the clock face itself is slowly spinning.

A. R,S widget controls Radius and Speed.
B. X,Y widget controls speed of rotation around X and Y axes.
C. "A" toggles gear active / inactive.
D. "H" alters parameters to nearest 'harmonic value'.  Sort of works...

1600 points are calculated, and connected by lines.

Assuming all 4 gears are active:
The first gear determines where the point is in relation to the center of the image.
The 2nd gears' point is in relation to the first gears' point.
The 3rd gears' point is in relation to the 2nd gears' point.
The 4rd gears' point is in relation to the 3rd gears' point.

Pinch images for zoom, 2 finger swipe to Pan, 1 finger to rotate.
Tap image to stop rotation.

Image is rendered twice, for 'cross-eyed' 3D viewing.
With the iPad held two feet away,
slightly cross your eyes so that there is a third image in the middle.
Relax your gaze, and concentrate only on that middle image, which is in 3D.
